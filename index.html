	<h1>About</h1>
			 <p class="presentation">Gaël(le) Emilia is a character: an agency concerned about imagination and trans* materialities. Hir works range from academic research to artistic expressions, including cinema, video art, performance, new media and mixed proposals. After focusing in audiovisual and writing Gaël(le) is slowly introducing hir artistic production and research into fields as scenic and net arts. As an agency, Gaël(le) tries to disclose the singular conditions of each production, which are often hidden behind disciplinary boundaries. That implies exploring aesthetic fields that seem just “incorrect” to an aesthetical tradition built upon the author-work normative production. That approach allows ze to commit hir production with contingency and singularity, and because of that, to consider each component of a given production as full of potencies. As hir artistic and thinking approach conceives processes as more important than products and contextual intervention more important than originality, collaborations and collective productions are an important component of hir proposal. That has led ze to consider dialogic procedures such as interviews, records and criticism as fecund fields for thought and expression and not only as secondary works.&nbsp;</p>

  <h1>Current Projects</h1>
			<p class="presentationcurrent">Nowadays, my research is focused on liturgical procedures. On which performative ceremonies, objects and gestures lies social validation? In which manner does liturgy inhabit our conceptions of art and politics?
                       <p class="presentationcurrent">This guidelines are linked to my latest artistic production, in which I tried to intervene in a creative way the liturgical conventions of film production. Film projects as  "Latinoamérica" and "Adiós D.F." were a dialog with strong aesthetic conventions, and in that sense, the attempt was  to accept certain conventions on film production (ex. Western pictorial composition) and to intervene others (such as the split between fiction and documentary and the psychological approach to characters). In this moment, my target is strictly liturgical conventions, and because of that, my production is oriented to artistic practices that allow me to intervene them in a more direct way. That has led me to focus on new media and performance.  </p>  
			 <p class="presentationcurrent"> Although writing and audiovisual mixed forms remain important, net and scenic expression are also current concerns to me. That's why I'm interested in translating writing and filming tools to other material domains.</p> 
  <p class="presentationcurrent"> Meanwhile, my philosophical research, that used to be oriented to imagination and embodiment, is now focused on liturgy genealogy, particularly, the influence of liturgy in modern cultural and juridical conventions. </p> 
  <p class="presentationcurrent">
	As in the last years, all my production is structured around the idea of trans creativity: an exploration of the interactive possibilities between formal structures and informational processes, influenced by trans* gender studies and practices and by the processual thinking of philosopher Gilbert Simondon.

	<li class="licontent">"Adiós D.F"(Goodbye, D.F.)Feature film. 63m. (Rough cut)<img class="imgcontent" src="images/Adis-D.F.-ilustracin.png" width="500" height="224" alt=""> </li>
  <p class="descriptiontres">Goodbye, D.F. Is at the same time a farewell letter to a city that disappears and a testimony of what such a farewell will condemn to oblivion. This testimony is presented from the perspective of Gaël(le), an inhabitant of Mexico City whose life -and name- has changed in a parallel way as Distrito Federal (D.F.) is transformed into Ciudad de México (CDMX). Goodbye D.F. combines two temporalities: on one hand, the course of Gaël(le)'s last day in the city. On the other, the intervention of the Gaël(le)’s film archives in recent years, which show how their bond with certain processes in and with the city extinguishes, this resolves in the disappearance of both the city itself and the category of inhabitants who shared Gaël(le)'s perspective and purpose. The visual proposal tries to respect the luminous course of a day, which is only interrupted by the irruption of some fragments of Gaël(le)'s archive material. Gaël(le) is both the protagonist and the architect of the film, and therefore the film testifies the strategies and procedures they developed for capturing the changes in the city and in their own spaces and environments. We can observe the process of filming the film itself, and also how the planning of the shooting process obeys Gaël(le)'s need to say goodbye to everything that has constituted their life and themself, now that they must imminently leave a city that no longer even has the same name they once knew. Goodbye D.F. does not obey the conventional partition between objectivity and subjectivity, nor does it seek to separate characters from authors or to coin the scientific attitude of the objectivist documentary. The film seeks, more than to hide its conditions of a production-process, to disclose them, and by doing so unveils its intentions and its gadgets within the production of cinematographic language. Like some of Le Corbusier's constructions, some fragments of Jean-Luc Godard's filmography or a prepared piano concert, it seeks a style based in the material contingency of the production rather than to adapt the production conditions to stylistic requirements. This proposal is one of the most important political commitments of Goodbye D.F., and this commitment is intimately linked to a conception of politics as agency-based rather than restricted to representation. In Goodbye D.F. the documentation of a film performance is more important than the urge to portray characters, and this proposal comes from the concern to distance oneself from the processes of appropriation of social and political problems that are permitted and made profitable by realistic aesthetics. This problem is accentuated now that the economic management of cultural production ―based on identity policies― has become a common procedure. In this spirit, Goodbye D.F. bears witness to the technical devices through which Gaël(le) was able to elaborate and intervene the images with which they bids farewell to Mexico City. </p>

			<h1>Taller de Filosofía Expandida</h1>
												

		<p></p>
		<p class=presentation>Taller de filosofía expandida (Expanded philosophy workshop) is an attempt to explore and enforce other  basis for thought than texts (specially those that remain conditioned by the materiality of paper books) and other maners of composition than (mono)authoral writing.  The aim of this project is to propose assemblages and events such as experimental conversatories, records, interviews, collective and carachter-based works. 			</p>
